#+title: Flycheck-grammalecte

Integrate the french grammar and typography checker [[http://www.dicollecte.org/][Grammalecte]] with
[[http://www.flycheck.org/][flycheck]] to automatically look for mistakes in your writings. It also
provides an easy way to find synonyms and antonyms for a given word (to
avoid repetitions for exemple). This package is of very little interest
for other languages.

This package has a strong dependency on ~python3~. The installation of
the right version of python is up to you.

/Flycheck grammalecte/ is available on MELPA stable and unstable. Please
read the [[https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/InstallingPackages][Installing Package documentation]] from the EmacsWiki to know
more how to install a package. A [[./MANUAL_INSTALL.org][manual installation procedure]] exists
too if you prefer.

If you install /Flycheck grammalecte/ as a package, you need to add the
following line somewhere in your GNU Emacs config file:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(require 'flycheck-grammalecte)
#+end_src

Then restart GNU Emacs.

Finally, the last expected step is to download the
[[https://grammalecte.net/#download][CLI & Server upstream package]]. Just enter the following command:
~M-x flycheck-grammalecte-download-grammalecte~

* Configuration

All options are accessibles with ~customize~. In GNU Emacs, enter
~M-x customize~, then click on ~Editing~, then ~I18n~, and finally on
~Flycheck Grammalecte~.

You can also set this variables in your GNU Emacs config file. Here is
a quick reference of the available variables:

- ~flycheck-grammalecte-report-spellcheck~ :: If this variable is set to
     ~nil~, Flycheck will *not* report spellchecking error. Only grammar
     errors will be notified. This can be handy when you want to use
     /flyspell/ or /ispell/. Default is ~t~.
- ~flycheck-grammalecte-report-grammar~ :: If this variable is set to
     ~nil~, Flycheck will *not* report grammar error. Only spellchecking
     errors will be notified. Default is ~t~.
- ~flycheck-grammalecte-report-apos~ :: If this variable is set to
     ~nil~, Flycheck will *not* report typographical apostrophes (’)
     error. This can be usefull when your main editor mode manage
     apostrophe by itself (like LaTeX, org-mode export…). Default is
     ~t~.
- ~flycheck-grammalecte-report-nbsp~ :: If this variable is set to
     ~nil~, Flycheck will *not* report non-breakable spaces
     error. This can be usefull when your main editor mode manage
     spaces by itself (like LaTeX, org-mode export…). Default is ~t~.
- ~flycheck-grammalecte-report-esp~ :: If this variable is set to
     ~nil~, Flycheck will *not* report useless spaces and tabs error.
     This can be usefull when your main editor mode manage spaces by
     itself (like LaTeX, org-mode export…). Default is ~t~.
- ~flycheck-grammalecte-enabled-modes~ :: This variable stores the list
     of major modes for which /flycheck-grammalecte/ must be
     used. *Warning*, this variable must be set *before* loading
     ~flycheck-grammalecte~ itself. Thus, do not try to set it with
     ~customize~. Put it directly in your GNU Emacs config file.
     Default is ~’(org-mode text-mode mail-mode latex-mode)~. To add
     markdown mode, for example, use the following line:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq flycheck-grammalecte-enabled-modes
      '(org-mode text-mode mail-mode latex-mode markdown-mode mu4e-compose-mode))
(require 'flycheck-grammalecte)
#+end_src

* Usage

Enable /flycheck/ in a buffer, which major mode is declared in
~flycheck-grammalecte-enabled-modes~, and voilà!

If you are looking for a better word at some place, you can use the
function ~flycheck-grammalecte-find-synomyms-at-point~ (which will take
the word at point to find synonyms and antonyms) or the simpler
~flycheck-grammalecte-find-synomyms~ (which will ask you for a word
before doing the search). Pro tip: these functions are available even in
buffer, which major mode is not in the
~flycheck-grammalecte-enabled-modes~ list.

This package would have not existed without the nice work of the people
behinds the [[https://grammalecte.net/][Grammalecte]] and the [[http://crisco.unicaen.fr/des/synonymes/synonyme][“Dictionnaire Électronique des
Synonymes”]] projects.
